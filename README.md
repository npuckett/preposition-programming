# P5.js Preposition Programming

An interactive collection of P5.js sketches that demonstrate how spatial, directional, and temporal prepositions can be translated into code.

**[Visit the Interactive Website](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/)**

## Overview

This project explores the fascinating intersection between language and programming by converting English prepositions into visual, interactive P5.js sketches. Each preposition is demonstrated through carefully crafted animations that illustrate the spatial, directional, or temporal relationship that the word represents.

The collection serves as both an educational resource for understanding prepositions and a creative exploration of how natural language concepts can be expressed through code and visual design.

## Preposition Categories

### Spatial Relationships

**[Above](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-above.html)**  
Demonstrates objects positioned higher than a reference point. Features a yellow circle floating above a blue platform, illustrating vertical spatial relationships and the concept of "higher than."

**[Below](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-below.html)**  
Shows objects positioned lower than a reference point. A yellow circle appears below a blue platform, demonstrating downward spatial positioning and "lower than" relationships.

**[Between](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-between.html)**  
Illustrates positioning in the space separating two objects. A yellow circle moves between two blue barriers, showing how objects can occupy the space that separates other elements.

**[Among](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-among.html)**  
Demonstrates being surrounded by or in the midst of multiple objects. A yellow circle navigates among several blue circles, illustrating the concept of being within a group or collection.

**[Beside](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-beside.html)**  
Shows objects positioned next to or alongside each other. A yellow circle appears beside a blue rectangle, demonstrating side-by-side spatial relationships.

**[Behind](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-behind.html)**  
Illustrates objects positioned at the back or rear of another object. Features layered elements where one object is visually behind another, showing depth and occlusion.

**[Beneath](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-beneath.html)**  
Demonstrates objects positioned under or below another object, similar to "below" but often with a sense of being covered or protected by the object above.

**[Within](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-within.html)**  
Shows objects contained inside the boundaries of another object. A yellow circle moves within the confines of a blue rectangle, illustrating containment and boundary relationships.

**[Through](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-through.html)**  
Demonstrates movement from one side of an object to the other, passing inside or across. A yellow circle travels through a blue barrier, showing penetration and passage.

### Movement & Direction

**[Toward](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-toward.html)**  
Illustrates movement in the direction of a target object. A yellow circle moves toward a blue target, demonstrating directional movement and approach.

**[Away](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-away.html)**  
Shows movement in the opposite direction from a reference point. A yellow circle moves away from a blue object, illustrating departure and increasing distance.

**[Across](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-across.html)**  
Demonstrates movement from one side of a barrier to the other. A yellow circle crosses across a blue barrier, showing traversal and crossing movement.

**[Along](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-along.html)**  
Illustrates movement that follows the length or path of another object. A yellow circle moves along a blue path, demonstrating parallel movement and following.

**[Around](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-around.html)**  
Shows circular or curved movement surrounding an object. A yellow circle orbits around a blue circle, illustrating encirclement and surrounding motion.

**[Into](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-into.html)**  
Demonstrates movement from outside to inside a container or boundary. A yellow circle moves into a blue rectangle, showing entry and containment.

**[Onto](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-onto.html)**  
Illustrates movement that results in being positioned on top of a surface. A yellow circle moves onto a blue platform, demonstrating surface contact and positioning.

**[Past](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-past.html)**  
Shows movement that goes beyond or by another object without stopping. A yellow circle moves past a blue barrier, illustrating bypass and continuation.

**[Over](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-over.html)**  
Demonstrates movement above and across another object. A yellow circle travels over a blue barrier in an arc, showing elevation and crossing.

**[Under](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-under.html)**  
Illustrates movement beneath another object. A yellow circle travels under a blue barrier, demonstrating passage below and underneath movement.

### Time-based

**[Before](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-before.html)**  
Demonstrates temporal precedence where one event occurs prior to another. Shows sequential timing with visual indicators of what happens first in a timeline.

**[After](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-after.html)**  
Illustrates temporal sequence where one event follows another. Demonstrates the concept of subsequent timing and events that occur following a reference point.

**[During](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-during.html)**  
Shows events occurring simultaneously or within the timeframe of another event. Illustrates concurrent timing and overlapping temporal relationships.

**[Since](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-since.html)**  
Demonstrates duration from a specific starting point to the present. Shows continuous time passage from a marked beginning point forward.

**[Until](https://npuckett.github.io/preposition-programming/preposition-until.html)**  
Illustrates duration up to a specific endpoint. Features a progress bar that fills until reaching 100%, demonstrating time or action continuing up to a limit.
